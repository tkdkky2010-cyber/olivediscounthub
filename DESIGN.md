The design embodies a **fresh, energetic, and clean** atmosphere typical of modern K-Beauty platforms. It uses a high-contrast foundation of stark white and rich black, punctuated by a signature **vibrant olive green** that conveys natural freshness and brand identity. The layout is mobile-first, distinct, and highly functional.

* **Pure White (`#FFFFFF`)**: The canvas background, ensuring clarity and product focus.
* **Jet Black (`#000000`)**: Primary text color for maximum readability and contrast.
* **Soft Gray (`#F5F5F5`)**: Background for sections to create separation without harsh lines.
* **Alert Red (`#FF0000` or similar)**: Used sparingly for discount badges and sale alerts.
